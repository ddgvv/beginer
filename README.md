#In this train Reservation System...
#I am not submitting the full implementation.....

The three files given below should be put into same folder and then only you will be able to run it  
#bid txt file is used for gerenating booking id
#datedict txt file is used for giving availability of seats in the class specidied of that train...
#Note: Future work
   With this we'll be able to add as much trains and their details by keeping the dicts in a file and updating it..this is similar to what i did for datedict........
